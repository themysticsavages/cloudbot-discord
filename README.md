###### Running cloudbot in a channel in a Discord server
#
# Information

cloudbot-discord is a file server for Discord. It is best used in a __private Discord server__ since they are usually more formal than public ones. But you can put it in a public server if you want. This program is in __perpetual beta__, and it supports creating and deleting files and folders, listing the contents of a directory, changing directories, and some moderation features. You cannot write to files as of now, but it will be updated to include this feature soon, however.

(btw, in case you are a feminist reading console logs, yes, the bot is referred to as a he)

## Requirements

You will need Node.JS and the npm module 'Discord'. If you want to use the bot in Discord, link it to a server of yours [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=835841382882738216&scope=bot&permissions=68608). Then download the bot, modify the token at the bottom of the file, then run the JS program.

###### If you are not running this on a dedicated server for the bot, use this in a Discord server with others that you trust. Otherwise, go ahead.

## Role usage

For now creating and changing directories can be done by anyone, however, __deleting__ files and folders will require the *Administrator* role. This is because core files needed by the bot or files that people want to store could be deleted on purpose or by accident.

## Usage

To get all the commands, type 'c/help'
