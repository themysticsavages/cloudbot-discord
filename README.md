cloudbot-discord is a file server for Discord. It is best used in a __private Discord server__ since they are usually more formal than public ones. But you can put it in a public server if you want. This program is in __beta__, and it only __creates and deletes folders__ as of now. It will be updated more, however.

## Requirements
You will need Node.JS and the npm module 'Discord'. If you want to use the bot in Discord, link it to a server of yours [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=835841382882738216&scope=bot&permissions=68608), replace the example text at the bottom of the program with your token, and run it! 

###### If you are not running this on a dedicated server, use this bot in a server with others that you __trust__. Otherwise, you can go ahead.

## Role usage
Creating files does not require any special roles. However, deleting files requires the *Administrator* role. This is because people may have files that they want to keep on the server running the bot, and random people may go and delete those files. So, the admin is the only one who can do this. Also, this stops people from deleting the bot file itself.
