###### Running cloudbot in a channel in a Discord server
#
# Information

cloudbot-discord is a file server for Discord. It is best used in a __private Discord server__ since they are usually more responsible than public ones. But you can put it in a public server if you want. This bot is in __perpetual beta__, and it supports file and folder management and banning members.

You cannot write to files as of now (which sucks), but it will be updated to include this feature soon, however.

## Requirements

If you want to use the bot in Discord, link it to a server of yours [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=835841382882738216&scope=bot&permissions=68608). 

If you want to run a modified version of the bot, make a new bot and join it to your server with the permissions 'Read message history, Send Messages, View Channels, and Ban Members'. Then download the bot.js file, modify the file, and run it with NodeJS.

## Role usage

For now creating and changing directories can be done by anyone, however, __deleting__ files and folders will require the *Administrator* role. This is because core files needed by the bot or files that people want to store could be deleted on purpose or by accident.

## Usage

To get all the commands, type 'c/help'. For more detailed help, type a command like 'c/mkdir' and add '/help' to the command.

## Recently added features

- __Ban users__

## Features/hotfixes to be added

- __Write to files (if writable)__

## Current bugs

*None. If there are bugs, list them in issues.
