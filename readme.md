###### Running cloudbot in a channel in a Discord server (mind the image, it does not have the right command names)
#
# Information

cloudbot-discord is a file server for Discord. It is best used in a __private Discord server__ since they are usually more responsible than public ones. But you can put it in a public server if you want. This bot is officially in a stable release, and it supports file and folder management, banning members, and many other pointless commands.

You can write to files now, but only one line and one string, plus you can't use "" (still kinda bad but ok)

## Requirements

You need NodeJS and the npm module 'discord'.

```
Warning! Issues might occur installing the Discord module if you use it on versions of Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC
```

If you want to use the bot in Discord, link it to a server of yours [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=835841382882738216&scope=bot&permissions=68608). 

If you want to run a modified version of the bot, read [setup.md](https://github.com/themysticsavages/cloudbot-discord/blob/main/setup.md).

## Role usage

For now, most functions can be done by anyone, however, __deleting__ files and folders requires the *Administrator* role. This is because core files needed by the bot or files that people want to store could be deleted on purpose or by accident.

## Usage

To get all the commands, type 'c/help'. For more detailed help, type a command 'c/help/' and add a command name like 'random'.

## Recently added features

- __Clear the console window__
- Clear an entire channel (almost)
- Make a random number

## Features/hotfixes to be added

- __Rename files__

## Current bugs

*None. If there are bugs, list them in issues.*
