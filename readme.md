###### Running cloudbot in a channel in a Discord server
#
# Information

cloudbot-discord is a file server for Discord. It is best used in a __private Discord server__ since they are usually more responsible than public ones. But you can put it in a public server if you want. __This bot is officially in a release channel__. It supports file management, banning members, and many other pointless commands. If you want to give it a name, call it Cybrex or something.

## Self hosting

For self-hosting, you will need nodejs and python. You can download both of these things at the bottom of the README. Next, just run `initialize.cmd` and choose the second option. No need to thank me.

*[Read setup.md](https://github.com/themysticsavages/cloudbot-discord/blob/main/setup.md) for further information on self-hosting.*

## Commands
Check out the commands [here](https://ajskateboarder.github.io/cloudbot).

## Addons

Addons, like webscraper, are tiny Python or Node.JS scripts which are added on to the main bot. It is much simpler to edit then incorperate every single piece of code with the bot. If you want a specific extension configuration, you can add and remove extensions by setting extensions in the addons section of `config.json` to either `true` or `false`.
