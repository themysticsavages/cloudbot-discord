###### Running cloudbot in a channel in a Discord server
# Information

cloudbot-discord is a file server for Discord. It is best used in a __private Discord server__ since they are usually more responsible than public ones. But you can put it in a public server if you want. ~~This bot is officially in a stable release~~ Nah, it isn't anywhere near stable. It supports file and folder management, banning members, and many other pointless commands.

## Requirements

You need NodeJS and the npm module 'discordjs'.

If you want to use the bot in Discord, link it to a server of yours [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=835841382882738216&scope=bot&permissions=68608). I have a virtual server now which runs the bot, so that's great. It has 16 GB of storage and a 4th gen Core i5 single core processor, which is good. Although it may not be online everyday, it is mostly online.

If you want to run a modified version of the bot, read [setup.md](https://github.com/themysticsavages/cloudbot-discord/blob/main/setup.md).

## Role usage

For now, most functions can be done by anyone, however, __deleting__ files and folders requires the *Administrator* role. This is because core files needed by the bot or files that people want to store could be deleted on purpose or by accident.

## Usage

To get all the commands, type 'c.help'. For more detailed help, type a command 'c.help.' and add a command name like 'random'.

## Recently added features

- __Clear the console window__
- Clear an entire channel (almost)
- Make a random number

## Features/hotfixes to be added

- __Rename files__
- Stop users from creating files that are reserved device names for servers in Windows (aux, nul, etc.)

## Current bugs

*None. List bugs in Issues if any*
